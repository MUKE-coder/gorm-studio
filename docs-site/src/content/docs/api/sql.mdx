## POST /studio/api/sql

Execute a raw SQL query. Not available when `DisableSQL` is set to `true`.

**Request:**

```json
{"query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true"}
```

---

### Read Queries

Queries starting with `SELECT`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `EXPLAIN`, or `PRAGMA` are treated as read queries.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "columns": ["id", "name", "email", "active"],
  "rows": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "active": true}
  ]
}
```

The response includes a `columns` array preserving column order and a `rows` array of objects keyed by column name.

---

### Write Queries

`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries are treated as write queries. Not available in ReadOnly mode.

**Response:**

```json
{"affected_rows": 3}
```

---

### Blocked Statements

These DDL statements are always blocked regardless of ReadOnly mode:

- `DROP`
- `ALTER`
- `TRUNCATE`
- `CREATE`
- `ATTACH`
- `DETACH`
- `GRANT`
- `REVOKE`

**Error response:**

```json
{"error": "DDL statements (DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, CREATE, etc.) are not allowed"}
```

DDL operations are blocked to prevent accidental schema changes through the SQL endpoint. Use the schema import endpoints or manage schema changes through your application's migration system instead.
