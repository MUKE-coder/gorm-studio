GORM Studio detects and exposes relationships between your tables, making it easy to navigate related data through both the web UI and the API.

## Supported Relationship Types

GORM Studio supports all four GORM relationship types:

- **belongs_to** — the model contains a foreign key pointing to another table
- **has_one** — another table has a foreign key pointing back to this model
- **has_many** — another table has multiple rows referencing this model
- **many_to_many** — a join table connects two models

## Defining Relationships in GORM Models

Relationships are detected from GORM struct tags on your Go models:

```go
type User struct {
    ID       uint      `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Name     string    `gorm:"size:100"`
    Posts    []Post    `gorm:"foreignKey:UserID"`
    Profile  Profile   `gorm:"foreignKey:UserID"`
}

type Post struct {
    ID     uint   `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Title  string `gorm:"size:255"`
    UserID uint
    Tags   []Tag  `gorm:"many2many:post_tags"`
}

type Profile struct {
    ID     uint   `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Bio    string
    UserID uint
}

type Tag struct {
    ID   uint   `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Name string `gorm:"size:50"`
}
```

In this example:

- **User has_many Posts** — a user can have multiple posts, linked via the `UserID` foreign key on the `Post` model.
- **User has_one Profile** — each user has a single profile, linked via the `UserID` foreign key on the `Profile` model.
- **Post belongs_to User** — each post references its author through the `UserID` column.
- **Post many_to_many Tags** — posts and tags are linked through a `post_tags` join table, allowing each post to have multiple tags and each tag to apply to multiple posts.

## Viewing Relationships in the Schema Browser

When you select a table in the schema browser, all detected relationships are displayed alongside the column list. Each relationship shows:

- The relationship type (has_one, has_many, belongs_to, many_to_many)
- The related table name
- The foreign key or join table used

## Navigating Related Data

From any record detail view, you can navigate to related records. Click a relationship to see all associated rows in the related table.

### API Access

Fetch related records for a specific row using the relations endpoint:

```bash
# Get all posts for user with ID 1
GET /api/tables/users/rows/1/relations/Posts

# Get the profile for user with ID 1
GET /api/tables/users/rows/1/relations/Profile

# Get all tags for post with ID 5
GET /api/tables/posts/rows/5/relations/Tags
```

The relation name in the URL corresponds to the Go struct field name (e.g., `Posts`, `Profile`, `Tags`).
