description: "Execute raw SQL queries with automatic safety checks and DDL blocking."
---

The SQL editor lets you execute raw SQL queries directly against your database. It includes automatic safety checks to prevent destructive operations, making it suitable for development and debugging workflows.

## Executing Queries

Send a POST request to the SQL endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/studio/api/sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 10"}'
```

## Read vs Write Detection

GORM Studio automatically detects whether a query is a read or write operation. The following are classified as **read queries**:

- `SELECT`
- `SHOW`
- `DESCRIBE`
- `EXPLAIN`
- `PRAGMA`

All other DML statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) are classified as **write queries**.

### Read Query Response

Read queries return column names and rows as JSON:

```json
{
  "columns": ["id", "name", "email"],
  "rows": [
    {"id": 11, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
  ]
}
```

### Write Query Response

Write queries return the number of affected rows:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/studio/api/sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "UPDATE users SET name = '\''Jane'\'' WHERE id = 1"}'
```

```json
{
  "affected_rows": 1
}
```

## DDL Blocking

For safety, the following DDL and administrative statements are **always blocked**, regardless of mode:

- `DROP`
- `ALTER`
- `TRUNCATE`
- `CREATE`
- `ATTACH`
- `DETACH`
- `GRANT`
- `REVOKE`

Attempting to execute any of these will return an error. This prevents accidental schema changes or permission modifications through the studio interface.

## Read-Only Mode

When GORM Studio is configured with read-only mode, all write queries (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) are also blocked in addition to the DDL statements above. Only read queries are permitted.

## Disabling the SQL Editor

If you want to completely disable raw SQL execution, set the `DisableSQL` option in your configuration:

```go
studio.New(db, &studio.Config{
    DisableSQL: true,
})
```

When disabled, the SQL editor tab will not appear in the web UI and the `/api/sql` endpoint will return a `403 Forbidden` response.
