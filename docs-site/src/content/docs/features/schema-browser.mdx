description: "Explore your database schema with automatic introspection and GORM model reflection."
---

GORM Studio provides a powerful schema browser that gives you full visibility into your database structure. It uses **dual-source schema discovery**: it introspects the actual database AND parses GORM model structs via reflection. This means you get a complete picture of your schema, including relationships that only exist in your Go code.

## How It Works

The schema is cached at startup for fast access and can be refreshed at any time via the refresh button in the web UI or programmatically:

```bash
POST /api/schema/refresh
```

To retrieve the full schema:

```bash
GET /api/schema
```

This returns a `SchemaInfo` object containing every table, column, relationship, and row count.

## Schema Data Structures

The schema API returns data in the following structure:

```go
type SchemaInfo struct {
    Tables []TableInfo
    Driver string // "sqlite", "postgres", "mysql"
}

type TableInfo struct {
    Name      string
    Columns   []ColumnInfo
    Relations []RelationInfo
    RowCount  int64
}

type ColumnInfo struct {
    Name         string
    Type         string
    IsPrimaryKey bool
    IsNullable   bool
    DefaultValue string
    IsForeignKey bool
    ForeignTable string
    ForeignColumn string
}
```

## What Gets Discovered

For each table, GORM Studio discovers:

- **Column names** and their database types
- **Nullable** status for each column
- **Primary keys**, including composite keys
- **Default values** defined at the database level
- **Indexes** for understanding query performance
- **Foreign keys** linking tables together

## Relationship Detection

Relationships are detected from GORM struct tags, including:

- `foreignKey` — specifies the foreign key column
- `references` — specifies the referenced column
- `many2many` — specifies the join table for many-to-many relationships

## Web UI

The web UI presents the schema in an intuitive layout:

- A **table list** in the sidebar displays all tables along with their row counts
- Click any table to see its **columns**, **types**, and **relationships**
- Use the **refresh button** to re-introspect the database after schema changes
