title: Introduction to GORM Studio
description: A Prisma Studio-like visual database browser and management tool for Go applications using GORM.
---

GORM Studio is a powerful, browser-based visual database management tool designed specifically for Go developers who use [GORM](https://gorm.io) as their ORM. If you have ever used Prisma Studio in the JavaScript ecosystem, GORM Studio brings that same intuitive experience to the Go world — allowing you to visually browse, query, and manage your database without leaving your development workflow.

## Why GORM Studio?

Working with databases during development often means switching between your editor, a terminal running raw SQL, and a separate database GUI. GORM Studio eliminates that friction by embedding a fully featured database browser directly into your Go application. It mounts as a route group on your existing Gin router, so there is nothing extra to deploy or configure.

## Features

### Schema Discovery

GORM Studio automatically introspects your database schema and combines it with GORM model reflection to build a complete picture of your data layer. Table names, column types, constraints, indexes, and relationships are all discovered and displayed without any manual configuration.

```go
// GORM Studio reads your model tags to understand the schema
type Product struct {
    ID          uint    `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Name        string  `gorm:"size:255;not null"`
    Price       float64 `gorm:"type:decimal(10,2)"`
    Description string  `gorm:"type:text"`
    CategoryID  uint    `gorm:"index"`
    Category    Category
    CreatedAt   time.Time
    UpdatedAt   time.Time
}
```

When you register this model, GORM Studio will display every column, its type, whether it is nullable, its default value, and any indexes — all in a clean, browsable interface.

### Browse and Filter

View your data in a paginated, sortable, and searchable table. Click any column header to sort ascending or descending. Use the search bar to filter rows across all text columns, or apply column-specific filters for precise queries.

- **Pagination** — Navigate large tables without loading everything into memory.
- **Sorting** — Click column headers to toggle sort direction.
- **Search** — Full-text search across string columns.
- **Column Filters** — Apply conditions like equals, contains, greater than, and more on individual columns.

### CRUD Operations

Create, read, update, and delete records through auto-generated forms. GORM Studio inspects your model's field types and GORM tags to render the appropriate input controls — text fields, number inputs, date pickers, dropdowns for enums, and toggles for booleans.

```go
// Enum-like fields get rendered as dropdowns
type Order struct {
    ID     uint   `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Status string `gorm:"type:varchar(20);default:'pending'"`
    Total  float64
    UserID uint
    User   User
}
```

### Relationship Navigation

GORM Studio understands all four GORM relationship types and lets you navigate between related records seamlessly:

| Relationship    | Example                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `has_one`       | User has one Profile             |
| `has_many`      | User has many Posts              |
| `belongs_to`    | Post belongs to User             |
| `many_to_many`  | Post has many Tags via join table|

Click on a related record to jump directly to it in the browser. Foreign key links are rendered as clickable references, making it easy to follow data relationships visually.

```go
type User struct {
    ID      uint      `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Name    string    `gorm:"size:100"`
    Profile Profile   // has one
    Posts   []Post    // has many
}

type Post struct {
    ID     uint   `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Title  string `gorm:"size:255"`
    UserID uint   // belongs to
    User   User
    Tags   []Tag  `gorm:"many2many:post_tags;"` // many to many
}

type Tag struct {
    ID    uint   `gorm:"primarykey"`
    Name  string `gorm:"size:50;uniqueIndex"`
    Posts []Post `gorm:"many2many:post_tags;"`
}
```

### Raw SQL Editor

For advanced queries that go beyond simple CRUD, GORM Studio includes a built-in SQL editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and safety checks. The editor warns you before executing destructive statements like `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, or `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause, helping prevent accidental data loss.

- Syntax highlighting for SQL.
- Auto-completion for table and column names.
- Safety confirmation prompts for destructive operations.
- Results displayed in the same sortable, paginated table view.

### Schema Export

Export your database schema in multiple formats for documentation, collaboration, or migration workflows:

| Format       | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **SQL**      | Standard DDL statements for recreating the schema |
| **JSON**     | Machine-readable schema representation            |
| **YAML**     | Human-readable schema representation              |
| **DBML**     | Database Markup Language for dbdiagram.io          |
| **PNG ERD**  | Entity-Relationship Diagram as a PNG image        |
| **PDF ERD**  | Entity-Relationship Diagram as a PDF document     |

### Data Import and Export

Move data in and out of your database with support for common file formats:

- **JSON** — Import and export records as JSON arrays.
- **CSV** — Spreadsheet-compatible comma-separated values.
- **SQL** — INSERT statements for migrating data between databases.
- **Excel** — `.xlsx` files for sharing data with non-technical stakeholders.

### Go Code Generation

GORM Studio can generate Go struct definitions from your existing database schema. This is especially useful when working with a database-first workflow or when onboarding onto a project with an existing database. The generated code includes proper GORM tags, field types, and relationship definitions.

```go
// Example of generated code from a "products" table
type Product struct {
    ID          uint      `gorm:"column:id;primarykey;autoIncrement"`
    Name        string    `gorm:"column:name;type:varchar(255);not null"`
    Price       float64   `gorm:"column:price;type:decimal(10,2)"`
    Description string    `gorm:"column:description;type:text"`
    CategoryID  uint      `gorm:"column:category_id;index"`
    CreatedAt   time.Time `gorm:"column:created_at"`
    UpdatedAt   time.Time `gorm:"column:updated_at"`
}
```

## Supported Databases

GORM Studio works with the three most popular databases in the Go ecosystem:

| Database       | Driver Package                    | Notes                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **SQLite**     | `github.com/glebarez/sqlite`      | Great for development and testing  |
| **PostgreSQL** | `gorm.io/driver/postgres`         | Recommended for production         |
| **MySQL**      | `gorm.io/driver/mysql`            | Full support including MariaDB     |

All features — schema discovery, CRUD, relationship navigation, SQL editor, import/export, and code generation — work consistently across all three database backends.
