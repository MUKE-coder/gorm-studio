description: Install GORM Studio and its dependencies into your Go project.
---

This guide walks you through installing GORM Studio and all required dependencies. The entire setup takes just a few commands.

## Prerequisites

Before installing GORM Studio, make sure you have:

- **Go 1.21 or later** — GORM Studio uses generics and other modern Go features that require Go 1.21+. Check your version with:

```bash
go version
```

- **An initialized Go module** — If you do not already have a `go.mod` file, create one:

```bash
go mod init your-module-name
```

## Install GORM Studio

Install the GORM Studio package using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/MUKE-coder/gorm-studio/studio
```

This pulls in the studio package, which contains the route handlers, the embedded frontend assets, and all the logic for schema introspection, CRUD operations, and data import/export.

## Install Required Dependencies

GORM Studio is built on top of [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com) (HTTP router) and [GORM](https://gorm.io) (ORM). You need both of these in your project:

```bash
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get gorm.io/gorm
```

## Install a Database Driver

You need at least one database driver. Install the one that matches your database:

### SQLite

SQLite is the easiest option for local development and testing. It requires no external database server — everything is stored in a single file.

```bash
go get github.com/glebarez/sqlite
```

Usage in code:

```go
import "github.com/glebarez/sqlite"

db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("app.db"), &gorm.Config{})
```

:::tip
SQLite is a great choice for getting started quickly. You can always switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL later without changing your GORM models.
:::

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the recommended choice for production deployments. It offers advanced features like JSONB columns, full-text search, and robust concurrent access.

```bash
go get gorm.io/driver/postgres
```

Usage in code:

```go
import "gorm.io/driver/postgres"

dsn := "host=localhost user=postgres password=secret dbname=myapp port=5432 sslmode=disable"
db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
```

### MySQL

MySQL (and MariaDB) are fully supported. Use this driver if your infrastructure is built around MySQL.

```bash
go get gorm.io/driver/mysql
```

Usage in code:

```go
import "gorm.io/driver/mysql"

dsn := "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/myapp?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"
db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
```

## All-in-One Installation

If you want to install everything at once, run all commands together:

```bash
# Core dependencies
go get github.com/MUKE-coder/gorm-studio/studio
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get gorm.io/gorm

# Pick your database driver (install one or more)
go get github.com/glebarez/sqlite       # SQLite
go get gorm.io/driver/postgres           # PostgreSQL
go get gorm.io/driver/mysql              # MySQL
```

After running these commands, tidy up your module to remove any unused indirect dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Verify the Installation

Create a minimal Go file to confirm everything compiles correctly:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    _ "github.com/MUKE-coder/gorm-studio/studio"
    _ "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    _ "gorm.io/gorm"
    _ "github.com/glebarez/sqlite"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("All dependencies installed successfully!")
}
```

Run it:

```bash
go run main.go
```

If you see `All dependencies installed successfully!` with no compilation errors, you are ready to proceed.

## Project Structure

A typical project using GORM Studio looks like this:

```
myapp/
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go          # Application entry point, mounts GORM Studio
├── models/
│   ├── user.go      # GORM model definitions
│   ├── post.go
│   └── category.go
└── app.db           # SQLite database file (if using SQLite)
```

GORM Studio does not impose any specific project layout. It only needs a `*gorm.DB` connection and a `*gin.Engine` router to work.

## Troubleshooting

### "go: module not found" errors

Make sure you are running `go get` from within a directory that has a `go.mod` file. If you have not initialized your module yet, run `go mod init your-module-name` first.

### CGO errors with SQLite

The `github.com/glebarez/sqlite` driver is a pure-Go implementation that does **not** require CGO. If you are using a different SQLite driver like `gorm.io/driver/sqlite` (which wraps mattn/go-sqlite3), you will need a C compiler installed. We recommend using the pure-Go driver listed above to avoid this issue entirely.

### Version conflicts

If you encounter dependency version conflicts, run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This resolves version requirements and removes unused dependencies. If conflicts persist, check that your `go.mod` specifies `go 1.21` or later in the `go` directive.

## Next Steps

With everything installed, head to the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start) guide to mount GORM Studio in your application and start browsing your data.
